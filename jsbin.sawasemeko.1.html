    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    
    
    
    <em><strong>for rice</em></strong>
    <ol> 
      <li>wash rice under running water until clear and drain</li>
      <li>in a blender chop and smoothly blend the tomatoes, peppers and half of the onion. Pour it into a sauce pan and boil to remove excess water. I get too tired sometimes, so I blend the tomato mix with less water or none; that way there is no need to boil it out and I just go straight to frying...</li>
      <li>Put a knob of butter into a cooking pot to melt;
        then pour in the oil and the other half of the onion(slice first). Sauté the onion until translucent; then add the curry, thyme, cloves, black pepper, white pepper and bay leaf. Stir fry for a few minutes; then add the tomato paste and fry until the paste looks a little dry. Add in the blended tomatoes along with the garlic, season with some bouillon(if using)and thoroughly fry until the mixture looks dark and the oil floats to the top (Drain off any excess oil). Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the raw rice; making sure the tomato mixture coats each grain. Pour in the meat stock, check for seasonings and return the pot to the heat. Bring the pot to a boil, cover with a foil wrapper to trap the steam; then reduce the heat. Cook the rice for about 10-15 minutes or until aldente; do not stir. If the rice is not soft enough after 15minutes, just put the foil wrapper and pot cover back on the pot and let it steam in it's own heat for another 10minutes(you may turn off the heat at this point or set your stove on the lowest heat). When the rice soft enough for your liking, grate in some nut meg and ginger and slice in the garnishes; then stir.
        Let the rice rest once more; then serve.</li>
